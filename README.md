# Tips

## This Repository

This repository is where Rutter McQuigg, Brandon Clark, and Bryan Tran are working on a project called Tips for a full stack development bootcamp. Tips is our submission for Project 2, which was to create a full stack application to demonstrate our proficiency in creating APIs, template engines, routing, databases, MVC structure, user session/cookies, mobile responsiveness, deployment, and authentication. 

Tips is a gig work tracking app that can help a user visualize their profitability. The app allows you to track your revenue, expenses, hours, miles driven, rain, and temperature. Users can view these metrics on a daily, monthly, or lifetime graph. These metrics are also used to calculate net income, hourly revenue, and profitability difference depending on rain or temperature.

## Usage

Once a user is logged in, they will be presented with a dashboard. The dashboard has navigation at the top, a chart in the middle, lifetime stats, and a workday entry form. After the fields have been entered, click the submit button to add your entry. The chart has a button for monthly view and yearly view.
